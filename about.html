        I'm Xiaoling(Sherlin) Chen. At present, I'm a student from Parsons, design and technology master degree. In the summer of 2015, I graduated from Baruch College. I've learned business for 4 years, and as an intern in national securities for half year. You maybe wonder why I switch my career path from business to some design. Because my experience of living and studying in New York 2 years ago enabled me to know myself deeply, and it also completely changed my life. New York provided me with many chances to know more about contemporary art. During my time in New York, I learned photography educated by Professor Joel, who is teaching interactive design as well. I have to say Joel absolutely influenced my self-insight creation on art. <br/>After I accessed to photography, then I was crazy to attend lots of art exhibitions and art museums, such as the exhibition of "Rain Room", MOMA, and the Echo Corridor in the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. Etc. All of these experiences triggered my keen interest in interactive art. Artists in this field combine music and lights with innovative technologies, draw complex yet beautiful pictures based on data processed by computer software, or redesign old-fashioned objects to provide users with new usage experience. <br/>All of these made me surprised while letting me be enchanted by this dramatic field. So I'm on my way NOW and persist trying to do some wonderful design.
